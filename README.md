- 👋 Hi, I’m @jicluke
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology to create human experiences and empower disadvantaged people with access to the legal system.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react, node, and a whole lot about proper system + data architecture
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to make the archaic process of estate planning and administration (i.e., wills, trusts, health care directives, etc.) accessible and affordable to ordinary people like you and me 
- 📫 Looking to reach me? Send me an email at luke@justincaseestates.com
